# Terrible-Discord-Music-Bot
Just like, the worst music bot you could make.

Stuff you need:
* Node
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl-core
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytsearch
* https://www.ffmpeg.org/

Can't be bothered to write too much here because you should not use this.
This is some absolute Yandere Dev level coding here.

Create a config.json file with the token, of course. 

I am aware commands should be in different files; and yes I am aware that it barely functions/ crashes a lot; and yes there are not a lot of features; and yes, the shuffle function is empty, deal with it.
